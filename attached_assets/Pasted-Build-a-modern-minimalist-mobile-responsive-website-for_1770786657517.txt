Build a modern, minimalist, mobile-responsive website for a D2C lifestyle and grooming brand called "Tenzo". 

The design should feel like "Muji meets Apple"—clean, zen, and essential.

### TECH STACK & COMPONENTS:
- React + Tailwind CSS + Lucide Icons.
- UI Library: Shadcn UI (for Buttons, Cards, Inputs).
- **HERO BACKGROUND:** Use the "@react-bits/ColorBends-JS-CSS" component. Configure the colors of the bends to match my brand palette below (Green, Grey, and White).

### BRAND THEME & COLORS:
- **Primary (Matcha):** #5B7C62
- **Background (Stone Grey):** #F2F0EB
- **Text (Sumi Ink):** #2D2D2D
- **Accent (Sunset Clay):** #D17D59
- **Fonts:** Use a clean Sans-Serif (like Montserrat for headings, Inter for body).

### PAGE STRUCTURE:

**1. HERO SECTION (Full Screen)**
- Background: The ColorBends animation using #5B7C62 and #F2F0EB.
- Center Content:
  - Logo Text: "TENZO" (Bold, tracking-wide).
  - Subtitle: "Essential Living. Curating the best grooming & lifestyle gear for the modern Indian."
  - Primary CTA Button: "Join the Community" (Links to Instagram).

**2. "WHAT WE DO" SECTION (3-Column Grid)**
- Use simple Card components with Icons.
- Card 1: "We Curate" – "Hunting the best gear under ₹1000."
- Card 2: "We Build" – "Designing premium essentials based on your feedback."
- Card 3: "We Connect" – "A community of modern minimalists."

**3. QUICK LINKS (Linktree Style)**
- A section with wide, full-width buttons for mobile users.
- Button 1: "📸 Follow on Instagram (@TenzoGoods)" (Outline style).
- Button 2: "💬 Join WhatsApp Group" (Outline style).
- Button 3: "🛒 Top 5 Amazon Finds" (Solid Accent color).

**4. BLOG SECTION ("The Tenzo Edit")**
- Header: "The Journal".
- Display a grid of 3 placeholder blog posts.
- Example Post: Image placeholder, Category tag "Grooming", Title "5 Trimmers Under ₹1000 That Actually Last", and a "Read More" arrow.

**5. FOOTER**
- Simple text: "Designed in India. © 2026 Tenzo."
- Small links: Contact, Privacy.

### BEHAVIOR:
- Ensure the ColorBends background is subtle and slow-moving so text remains readable.
- Make sure the "Quick Links" section is very easy to tap on mobile.
